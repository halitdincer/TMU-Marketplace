# TMU Marketplace

## Introduction

Welcome to TMU Marketplace - a classified advertisements platform tailored specifically for students of TMU (Tokyo Metropolitan University). This web application provides a user-friendly interface for students to post and browse classified ads in various categories such as "Items Wanted", "Items for Sale", and "Academic Services". Our goal is to create a responsive and fully functional platform accessible on both desktop and mobile computing platforms, enhancing the TMU student community's experience in trading, selling, and academic collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

1. **Create Virtual Environment**

   If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   On Unix or MacOS, run:

   ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
    Your command line will now indicate that you're working inside venv.

3. **Installing Python Dependencies**

    With your virtual environment active, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command reads the requirements.txt file in your project directory and installs all the necessary Python packages.
