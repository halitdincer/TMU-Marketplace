# TMU Marketplace

## Introduction

Welcome to TMU Marketplace - a advertisements platform tailored specifically for students of Toronto Metropolitan University.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

1. **Create Virtual Environment**

   If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   On Unix or MacOS, run:

   ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
    Your command line will now indicate that you're working inside venv.

3. **Installing Python Dependencies**

    With your virtual environment active, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command reads the requirements.txt file in your project directory and installs all the necessary Python packages.
